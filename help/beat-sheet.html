<p>Beat A single story event which transforms the character and story at a critical juncture.</p>
<p>Are "checkpoints" along the way, that will complete the story and chart out a film structure.</p>
<p>Save the Cat - Blake Snyder boiled down plot structure down to 15 beats.</p>

<p>It is crucial to give your character a strong and clear need. After all, their desire will dictate yhe story of their lives, and dtive them toward the irreversible change of your finale.</p>

<h1>The Beat Sheet</h1>

<h2>1 - Opening Image [Page 1]</h2>

<p>Start strpmg with and image that catapults your audience into the look and feel of your story. Blake Snyder Suggests knocking this out on Page 1.</p>

<p>Intagram: @Finalscreens - shows how much story can be conveyed in the first and final images of a film.</p>

<p>The Matrix boasts a strong opening image: a blinking command line cursor.</p>

<p>The film is about a hacker named Neo (Keanu Reeves) who realizes his life is a computer simularwd reality (The Matrix). Over the image we hear Trinity and Cypher, on the "other end" of the cursor. They're liberated from The Matrix, and looking for their savior.</p>

<h2>2 - Theme Stated [Page 5]</h2>

<p>Film structure requires that the theme of the film is comunicated by someone fairly early on. Comonly, this dialog is spoken to the protagonist that he doesn't quite grasp yet.</p>

<p>In The Matrix, Neo moonlights as a creator of illegal software. One of his costumers tells him that looks like he "needs to unplug for a while". This subtly suggests that Neo will learn to unplug from his computer simulated reality, and how to fight those who were keeping him there.</p>


<h2>3 - Set-up Pages [Pages 1 - 10]</h2>

<p>Use your first ten pages wisely. Here, you'll need to establish your story scope (and "look and feel") for the audience.</p>

<p>First, show your character in their "Old World". Let the audience know what the status quo is for them, then hint at the adventure that follows.</p>

<p>Second, establish all characters who will factor into your main story beats. This make take some creativity; Sometimes, for story reasons, you will just have to hint at those Characters.</p>

<p>The setup is one of the most important sections of your scripts because it provides the essencial context needed for the audience to become either immediatly engaged, or lose interest within the first ten minutes. Obriousley, as a screenwriter, the former is required to sustain a carrer.</p>

<p>The Matrix begins with an action sequence cleverly to establish how there are people on the workd (Trinity, The Agents), who seem like they are from another place all toghether.</p>

<p>They defy the laws of physics, and seem go come and go as they please.</p>

<p>We also meet Neo, and learn that he senses this other world, but it is just beyonf his grasp. When you want your audience to get engaged quickly, it's these places of essencial context that will make that happen.</p>

<h3>4 - Catalyst [Page 12]</h3>

<p>Sometimes called the "inciting incident", the catalyst is the event that disrupts your ptoyagonist's status quo. But they are not ready to make the choice that catapults them into the story just yet.</p>

<p>In The Matrix, this happens when Neo meets Trinity in a club. She tells him that he's in danger.</p>

<p>The intiting incident gets us hooked, let's se what keeps us there.</p>

<h3>5 - Debate [Page 12-25]</h3>

<p>This is where the protagonist has doubts about setting out on their perious jorney. How does this beat manifest in The Matrix?</p>

<p>After tlaking to Trinity, Neo finds himself hunted by sunglasses-wearing "suits" (The Agents). Thankfully, he's on the phone with Morpheus - the leader of the rebelion Trinity represents.</p>

<p>However, Neo's not strong enough follow through on Morpheu's orders to escape his office building. Om Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey", this is called the refusal of the call.</p>

<h3>6 - Break into Two [Page 25]</h3>

<p>Inevitably, your protagonist will overcome his or her doubt and make a choice set out on their adventure. This is the choice that officially sets the plot into motion.</p>

<p>From here on out, your Save The Cat beat sheet template will be filled with obstacles and twists resulting from making this choice.</p>

<p>In The Matrix? You guessed it: this is where Neo takes the red pill (to unplug from The Matrix) over the blue pill (to resume status quo).</p>

<p>While you are writing, there's nothing wrong with planning ahead. With such important and symbolic props and motifs like the red and blue pills, you should know how to break down a script.</p>


<p>Identifying key elements is helpful for planning, but when you are still writing your story, other less obvious elements come into play</p>


<h3>7 - B story [Page 30]</h3>

<p>The A Story revolves around the choice your protagonist made as Act 1 breaks down into Act 2. But another subplot ensures, commonly a love story. Blake Snyder suggests this at around Page 30 to ilustrate the theme of your film.</p>

<p>The Matrix does not conform to this succinctly (remember, the Save the Cat Beat Sheet template only gives you suggested page counts).</p>

<p>The B Story is the blossoming romance between Neo and Trinity. It starts when they meet in the club, and blossoms once Neo has left the Matrix and is aboard the Nebuchadnezzar with Morpheus and his crew.</p>

<p>Trinity gives Neo strengh to believe that he's their savior.</p>


<h3>8 - Fyn and Games [Page 30-55]</h3>

<p>Thankfully, the Save the Cat Beat Sheet template is not just "all work and no play". Your plot structure requires a strech where your protagonist wields their new power, and does cool stuff with it.</p>

<p>In The Matrix, Neo enters a virtual program (The Construct), where Morpheus teaches him all kinds of fun stuff. Here he starts to hone martial arts skills and how to jump really high.</p>

<p>Heve fun with these scenes. Just make sure they make the world you are creating more interesting or serve a purpose. These scenes should also reinforce the "rules" of the world and what your hero can or can't do.</p>

<h3>9 - Midpoint [Page 55]</h3>

<p>At some point, the protagonist will either get what they are after... or not. But there will be consequences either way. Neo takes the red pill to see if really he's truly humanity's savior. But, at the midpoint, he goes to the clairvoyant Oracle to see if this is true.</p>

<p>She gives him a once-over and, tragically, tells him it's not true.</p>



<h3>10 - Bad Guys Close In [Pages 55-75]</h3>

<p>After your protagonist gets what they want, or not, there will be consequences. Those forces will tighten their grasp, and throw the protagonist off balance. Those forces don't necessarily have to be actual antagonists. It can also be fighting within the protagonist's circle.</p>

<p>Back to The Matrix. this is where Cypher betrays the team and allows the Agents to capture Morpheus. This thwarts the teams's relative control among chaos.</p>


<h3>11 - All Is Lost</h3>

<p>In film structure, the dire circunstances your protagonist endures will lead to an inevitable loss. This is usually a character, and classically the "mentor" (think Obi-Wan, Gandalf and Morpheus).</p>

<p>Whatever the loss, it's felt deeply because this item (or person) gave the protagonist their bearings. In The Matrix, this is where Morpheus is kidnapped, and Agent Smith presses him to give up the location of Zion - Humanity's safe haven.</p>

<p>Executing decisions like these might be challenging, but definettly necessary to create the best script. If you are writing with a team, or a partner, it might be even harder. Not everyone will agree, so it's a must to stay on the same page, along the way.</p>

<h3>12 - Dark Night of the Soul [Pages 75-85]</h3>

<p>This is the most dire circunstance your character reaches. At this point of the Save the Cat Beat Sheet template, your protagonist has lost hope.</p>

<p>In The Matrix, this is where Neo and his team com to the tragic realization that they have ti oull the plug on Morpheus.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the Agents might thwart humanity forever.</p>

<h3>13 - Break into Three [Page 85]</h3>

<p>Like a forest fire, loss and misery are followed by new life.</p>

<p>In plot structure, this is where your protagonist claws around in the darkness, only to find or remember something usefull. In The Matrix, Neo is reminded of critical information he gleaned from the Oracle.</p>

<p>This gives him the confidence to take arms and save Morpheus from the Agents against impossible odds. Trinity goes with him and we officially enter the final act of the film.</p>

<h3>13 - The Finale [Pages 85-110]</h3>

<p>Treat the finale as the Act 3 summary. The Save the Cat Beat SHeet template is at it's end, so it's time for the protagonist to take on their foes.</p>

<p>Armed with new tools and self-discoveries, the protagonist often sunthesizes wgat they've leaned *ub Act 2) with values they've always had (Act 1).</p>

<p>In The Matrix, Neo and Trinity put their training to the ultimate test to take the Agents snf liberate Morpheus. Eventually, Neo has to face the Agent Smith by himself.</p>

<p>He "unplugs" from the Oracle's logic and follows these feelings, which give him godlike powes in The Matrix. Hw Å› indeed The One, subdyes the Agents and completely disintegrates Agent Smith.</p>

<h3>15 - Final Image [Page 110]</h3>

<p>Along with the opening image, the final image creates de bookend that encapsulates the journey.</p>

<p>It's the last thing the audience sees, and should cement theme of the film, as well as represent what happened and chnge over the course of this journey.</p>

<p>The Matrix, closes on Neo. We hear his voiceover talk about the next steps of liberating these humans stuck in The Matrix. Then he takes flight! Being The One has endowed him with superhero qualities in The Matrix,  which he will now put to good use.</p>
