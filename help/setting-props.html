<h1>Setting</h1>

<p>Setting is the time and place the action of a literary work.</p>

<p>It colors how the characters think, what they can do, their dialog, yheir health, etc.</p>

<p>Each scene, while framed by the time period will have it's own Setting filled with countless oportunities to enrich the dialog.</p>

<p>Physical setting also include tone. Characteristics of the setting.</p>

<p>In order for you to utilize setting to its fullest when writing dialog, you need to anchor each scene's location as soon as possible. I weaves the setting in dialog exchanges and paint the reader firmly in the time and place of the scene.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest mistakes screenwriters nake is rushing through the opening, rather than allowing enough time for the reader to move from the real world into the fantasy world the writer has created" - Michael Hauge.</p>

<p>The overall setting of the book needs to be identified at the opening, but the setting of each scene should be vividly evoked for the reader.</p>

<p>Pick two or three details that will create a vivid image on the reader's mind.</p>

<p>"An apartment strewn with old pizza boxes and cigarette butts, where the posters of Pamela Lee adorn the waal" instead of simply "INT - Apartment"</p>

<p>The elements of setting include the physical sorrounfings, the environment in general, and the less tangibel mood of the chosen place.</p>

<p>The enrironment of a setting - the surroundings that affect a character such as heat, smog, or an open window that allows the breeze to come in. Look for things on the environment setting that can add texture to the scene. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the setting to get a better feel for the environment.</p>

<p>Mood - a more intangible factor that can vary depending on the moof you wish to convey in the scene.</p>

<p>Ex: </p>

<p>depression - Cloudy day, dirt-grimed room.</p>
<p>Contrast to the hero's depression - concentrate on brighth and colorfull aspects of the setting, such as a sunny day and a childen's laughter at a olayground.</p>

<p>Once the mood of the setting is establishing it's influence can then be woven into a character's dialog, helping the reader better relate to the character...</p>

<h2>Three Key Points</h2>

<p>Dwight Swann says there are three key points you need to remember about the world in which your story takes place.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 - Your reader never has been there.</l1>
<li>2 - It is a sensory world.</l1>
<li>3 - It is a subjective world.</l1>
</ul>

<h3>Your reader never has been there.</h3>

<p>The reader naver had been to this place but has gone to similar places and makes connections by association.</p>
 
<h3>It is a sensory world.</h3>
 
<p>We live in a world of colors, smells, textures, sound, and tastes.</p>

<p>What your hero or heroine sees.smells, touches, and tastes will add vivid imagery and umpact to what they say.</p>
 
<p>The five senses are also usefull in determining how the character percieves the world around them because we often favor onse sense over the other.</p>
 
<h3>It's a subjective world.</h3>
 
<p>We each have our own version of reality based on our life experiences.</p>
 
<p>Different aspects of the setting are going to impact each character differently. The age of the character, the gender of the character, the socioeconomica background if the characters, etc. All impact how the character is affected by the setting.</p>
 
<p>Once you have chosen the focal character, another tool you cab use wheb writing diaog is to figure out how your character absorbs information. According to educational research, yhe thtree basic eays of leaning are visual, kinestetic, and auditionary. Thus, the visual learner gathers new information via pictures and lreading. A kinesthetic learner gathers information through touching or doing. An auditory learner's gathers new information through listening.</p>
 
<p>The best learner utilizes all three ways of learning, but most of us tendo to rely more one one way than another. The way we process information incluences how we perceive the world around us.</p>
 
<h3>Setting IS A Mental Image.</h3>
 
<p>Whatever your setting, always remember it is a mental image the reader forms whi√ße reading your story.</p>
 
<p>Story settings encompass several aspects. There's the overall setting of the story (historical era, location) as well as the setting that usually changes from scene to scene.</p>
 
<h3>Exercise</h3>
 
<p>In one parapgraph, establish a setting. </p>

<p>Make a list of all the things that will impact tha character's dialog.</p>
 

<h2>You are the Set Designer</h2>

<p>Props is the abbreviated form of the phrase "stage properties" that refers to all the things appearing on the stage other than the scenary.</p>

<p>Props are also objects on the set used in a play or motion picture by an actor. Items such as phones, guns, cutlery, etc.</p>

<p>Set design starts with a rough sketch of the set and progresses to flor plans drawn to scale showing the general layout of each set.</p>

<h3>Scripts and Plays</h3>

<p>Screenwriters don't usually list props that will be needed ina a play or movie. They inly offer a verbal sektch of the setting they envision.</p>

<p>Using your imagination is called visualization or the act of forming mental images. "Visualization, The Art of Seeing the story" - What the writer can concieve, the reader can percive. </p>

<p>You want your set and props to enhance, not detract, from your scene and the dialog.</p>


<h3>Resources To Help the Writer With Setting</h3>

<p>Physical settings offer a writer a variety of props to give the characters things to do and ways to "show" their emotions or reactions without speach. Some people communicate more through yheir body language and tone of voice than they do through their actiual words, using props add depth to the characters's dialog.</p>
 
<h2>Body Language Talks</h2>
 
<p>Body language, aslo known as nonverbal communication, is the gesture and mecanisms by which a person communicates with others. Algthough one culture may have different meannings for some gesturess, body language os na inspoken language everybody speaks and most body language is universal.</p>

<ul>
<li>55% od coomunication consists of body language.</l1>
<li>38% of communication is expressed through tone of voice.</l1>
<li>7% of communication is expressed through words.</l1>
</ul>
 
<p>Kinesics - the study of the relationship between body motion patterns and their different meanings.</p>
 
<h3>Dificulty of Understaning Body Language.</h3>
 
<ul>
<li> Lift an eybrow to show disbilief</li>
<li> rub their nose to show puzzlement</li>
<li> scratch their head to show confusion</li>
<li> shrug shoulders to show indiference</li>
<li> wink to share intimacy</li>
<li> tap fingers to show indifference</li>
<li> wink to share intimacy</li>
<li> tap fingers to show impatience</li>
<li> slap their forhead to show thoughfulness</li>
<li> move jerkly to show frustration</li>
<li> lean forward suddenly to show forcefulness</li>
<li> play with thei ring to show nervouseness or gilt</li>
</ul> 
<p>You need to remember that it depends upon the context of the situation as to what the body movement means.</p>

<ul>
<li> lifting an eybrow may also mean surprise</li>
<li> rubbin the nose may also mean dislike</li>
<li> scratching the head may also mean you have a itch</li>
<li> shruggin the shoulders may also mean lack of knowledge</li>

<li> shrinking the body may also show relaxation</li>
<li> leaning forward suddenly could be a desire for attention</li>
<li> play with your fingers may also show boredom</li>
</ul>

<h3>Body Language is communication</h3>
 
<p>All behavior is communication and it is impossible not to communicate. Body language reflect's someone's</p>

<ul<
<li> Thoughts</li>
<li> Feelings</li>
<li> Opinion</li>
<li> Interest</li>
<li> Character</li>
<li> Health</li>
<li> Honesty</li>
<li> Tensions</li>
<li> Power</li>
<li> meanings</li>
</ul>
<p>Body language is connected to how we feel. This means the ability to utilize body language in our writing adds depth to our characters' emotions and ties them more firmly into the reader's emotions.</p>
